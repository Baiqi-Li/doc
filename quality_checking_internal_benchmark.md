## 2. Navigation

- Click on **"Internal Benchmark"** to access the checking system

## 3. Content Review and Standards

### 3.1 Review Task
- **Daily Requirement**: Check 20 randomly selected samples each day
- **Feedback**: Submit your findings and feedback to **Baiqi**

### 3.2 Content to Review
In each video pair, please review the following components:
- **Video captions**
- **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)**
- **Yes/No questions**

### 3.3 Review Standards
When checking each sample, evaluate the following criteria:

**a) Language Quality**
- Assess whether captions and questions are expressed naturally and fluently
- Check for grammatical errors and awkward phrasing

**b) Video-Caption Alignment**
- Verify that captions accurately align with the video content
- Ensure there are no mismatches between what's shown and what's described

**c) Question/Option/Answer Accuracy**
- Confirm that the answers to the question are correct for both videos in each pair.
- Check for consistency between the question logic and the provided options or expected answers.

  **Example of Logical Inconsistency:**
  
  The option *"The launched object did not fall off the table"* is logically inconsistent with the following question scenario:

  > **Question:** "What happened once the person removed an object from the tabletop?"
  > 
  > **Options:** ['No object was removed from the tabletop.', 'The launched object did not fall off the table.']
  > 
  > **Answer:** "The launched object did not fall off the table."

  ❌ This option doesn't logically address the action described in the question (removing an object). This answer does not logically follow from the question, which focuses on the consequences of removing an object. The selected option instead describes the state of a different object (“the launched object”), making it an illogical response.

**d) Question Difficulty**
- Evaluate whether questions can be reasonably answered based on the video content
- Identify questions that may be too difficult or impossible to answer correctly

**e) Video Quality**
- Check whether the video is clear
